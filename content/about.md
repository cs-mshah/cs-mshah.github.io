I have graduated with a bachelors degree in *Computer Science and Engineering* from [IIT Mandi](https://www.iitmandi.ac.in/). I am currently working as a research assistant at the [Vision and AI Lab, IISc](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/), where I work on diffusion models and 3D gaussian splatting. Go and check out my recent work - [Reflecting Reality: Enabling Diffusion Models to Produce Faithful Mirror Reflections](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/reflecting-reality.github.io/). Previously, I was a software development engineer at [Cashfree Payments](https://www.cashfree.com/). I've spent a summer (2022) interning at [Microsoft India Development Center | MSIDC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc) working with the STCI (Search Technology Centre India) team.

I am interested in working on challenging problems in computer vision and deep learning. I have a good experience with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/index.html) and experimentation with [Weights \& Biases](https://wandb.ai). I am open to collaborate on research projects related to computer vision.

In my free time, I like to fiddle with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and keep perfecting workflows to do several things (yeah I know it might decrease productivity at times, but it *does pay off*). Some other amazing communities that I love exploring and contributing include [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers), [Cohere For AI](https://cohere.for.ai/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/index.html) and [weights and biases](https://wandb.ai).

This blog is primarily about my learnings, experiences and thoughts. I feel that writing helps me to solidify different concepts and share some insights with others.
